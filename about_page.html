<h1> About Me </h1>

<p> I’m Johnnie Hornsby, a coding student who has been interested in helping and collaborating with people to bring their creative vision to life. I like to do this through programming and web design. I’ve been studying and practicing coding and the basics of coding for about 2 years now at my high school West Side Academy of Cyber Security and Technology. I briefly had an actual class with hardware and have learned to deconstruct a deskop and build an ethernet cable.


My hope is to assist people in having a creative visual. In the past I’ve had troubles translating my vision to where other people would understand. Instead of being stuck with great ideas I decided to learn a way to just show people. Also I know not everyone is computer literate and I want to bring access to the people who are at a disadvantage like I once was. I realized if I have these problems I most likely am not the only one with it so why not help others like me? </p>
