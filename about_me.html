<h1> About Me </h1>

</div>
<p>
I’m Johnnie Hornsby, a coding student  and rising senior at West SIde Academy. I like programming and web design and really any outlet for creativity. I’ve been studying and practicing coding and the basics of coding for about 2 years now at my high school West Side Academy of Cyber Security and Technology. For a semester, I had an actual class with hardware and have learned to deconstruct a deskop and build an ethernet cable. I also enjoy writing, drawing and journalism, I was the Cheif Editor at my schools part of DPSCD's newspaper.



My hope is to assist people in having a creative visual and really to help people in any way I can because I want my whole community to propser.
</p>
